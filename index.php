		<p>This is Jonathon Tully. Jonathon tinkers with Tesla cars (repairs and modifications) in his free time.
				Because Tesla does not make <strong>any</strong> of their information public, Jon needs to be able to connect with
				other Tesla hobbyists. He needs to able to see post chains, reply to initial posts and comments, be able to
				dm other users, and have the ability to view/post images and videos. Jon can't find any forums for this, and
				decides to make a subreddit. Here are the steps Mr. Tully takes:
		</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Jonathon enters reddit.com into his browser</li>
				<li>When the page loads, he logs in with his username and password</li>
				<li>Because Mr. Tully is a valued member of the community and meets reddit's requirements for account age
					and established merit via 'karma points', he is allowed to click on a button called "Create Community" on
					his reddit hompage.</li>
				<li>A small window pops up, asking for the name of your subreddit, whether you want it to public or invite
					only, and a brief description of your desired forum. Jonathon fills these out accordingly, and hits
					'create'</li>
				<li>And then Jon is done. The forum is created, and a community built upon free access to technological
					education can develop around him</li>

			</ul>
