<h1 align="center">How He Does It</h1>

<h2>Use Case:</h2>
	<p>As a Tesla enthusiast, Jonathon would like to create a community for his hobby.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Goals: Create a subreddit for Tesla Hobbyists hosted by reddit.com.</li>
			<li>Preconditions: Jon is a power user of reddit. This means he has a reddit account active for 30+days, and
				has enough positive "karma" to create a community. He is logged into his power user account, and is looking
				at his homepage.</li>
			<li>Postconditions: Jonathon has created a forum and moderates it.</li>
</ul>




<h3>Interaction Flow</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Jon clicks on "Create Community" on his reddit hompage.</li>
	<li>A small window pops up, asking for the desired name of the new subreddit, whether you want access to be public or
		private, and a brief description of what the content of the new forum should be about. Jonathon fills these out
		accordingly, and hits 'create'.</li>
	<li>And then Jon is done. The forum is created, and a community built upon free access to technological
		education can develop around him.</li>
</ul>
